*********************************
Style deductions (saturate at 10)
*********************************
* Missing or non-descriptive program header comment: -2 pts
* Missing or non-descriptive function header comments: -1 pt each,
  saturate at -2 pts
* Inconsistent indentation -1 pt each, saturate at -2
* Lines *greatly* exceeding 80 chars: -1 pt each, saturate at -2 pts
* Poor use of white space anywhere: -1 total
* Magic number(s) anywhere: -1 total
* Dead code (commented out rather than ifdef'd): -1 total
* Poor modularity: -2 total
* Not checking syscall return values:  -1 pt each, saturate at -3
* Any other egregious readability issue(s): -2 pts

******************
RealPages (20 pts)       
******************
* Proxy: Compile and run the student proxy on a shark machine. 
* Browser: Use the latest version of Firefox, TURN OFF CACHING
* Pages to check: Fetch exactly the following four pages:

http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~213
http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu
http://www.pku.edu.cn
http://dean.pku.edu.cn/pkudean/index.html
 
* Do all grading in proxylab/grading handy using the ./runHandinProxy.sh script.
* If a page loads correctly: 5 pts, no partial credit
* For each page, hit refresh to check for caching issues (see below).  

**********************
CorrectnessDeductions 
**********************
* One or more RealPages doesn't refresh: -5 
* Race condition or incorrect synchronization that was not caught by
  the autograder: -5
* No synchronization at all: -10 (don't double count for race)
* Cache doesn't approximate LRU: -5
* Cache eviction doesn't work: -5
* Memory leak or descriptor leak: -3
* Proxy terminates on syscall error: -5
* Proxy doesn't handle SIGPIPE signals: -3
* Synchronization doesn't allow for multiple concurrent readers: -5

To avoid double penalties, for each case (concurrency or cache),
saturate your deductions at min(10, driver points). For example, if a
student received 0 cache points, don't deduct anything. If they
received 15 cache points, deduct up to 10 points for cache errors.

*************
Special cases
*************
* If the driver fails on Autolab and passes on shark machines, then
  award the shark machine points

* If the student made a reasonable attempt and the code compiles, then
  20 pts partial credit.

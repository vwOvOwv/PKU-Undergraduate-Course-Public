Notes: Appply each deduction at most once, saturate at -15,
Don't deduct if the autograder already found errors
**********************
* waitfg spin loop with ; or sleep() instead of sigsuspend: -2
* Terminating shell if file passed to Open doesn't exist: -2

* Undetected race conditions, such as:
  * Allowing deletejob in handler to run before addjob in main: -3
  * waitfg spin loop with pause: -3
  * Not protecting accesses to global data structs that are shared with handlers: -3
  * Unblocking before sigsuspend: -3
  * Modifying jobs list in multiple handlers -3
  * Not waiting for the FG job in the builtins -3
  * Unblocking before printf (when running process in bg) -3
  * Not blocking around builtins
  * Using printf instead of sio routines in handlers: -3
      (printf is OK if it's in the body of an "if (verbose) statement)
  * Not saving and restoring errno in handlers: -1

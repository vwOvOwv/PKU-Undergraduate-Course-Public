CacheLab Grading (v3)

Here is the procedure to use when grading:

1. Use Autolab's code annotation feature to directly annotate the
   student's csim.c and trans.c files. (Visit cachelab->grade submissions
   and click on the little arrow next to the students email address).

2. For each deduction, use the drop-down box to make an explicit point
   deduction in the code and to associate it with a problem (either
   "Style" or "CorrectnessDeductions"). You can also provide other
   feedback in the code without making any point deductions.

3. Style grading for csim.c only. CorrectnessDeductions for csim.c
   (memory leaks) and trans.c (12 local variable rule)

4. When you have finished annotating a code file, click the "Reload"
   button at the top of the code file to scrape your comments and
   provide a summary of the point deductions at the top.

5. Enter the grade in the "Style" problem on the grade sheet, and in
   its feedback box, remind the students to view the details in the
   annotated code (this is important because sometimes students don't
   look in the annotated code). Don't forget to explicitly "save" the
   contents of the feedback box.

****************************************
Style deductions (saturate at -7 points)
****************************************
* Missing or non-descriptive program header comment: -2 pts
* Missing or non-descriptive function header comments: -1 pt each,
  saturate at -2 pts
* Inconsistent indentation: -2 pts
* Lines greatly exceeding 80 chars (egregious only): -1 pt each, saturate at -2 pts
* Poor error checking: -1
* Any other egregious readability issue(s): -2 pts

**********************
CorrectnessDeductions
**********************
* Violating 12 local variable rule: -5 pts. 
  We're only looking for really egregious violations here, so you
  don't need to be too strict.

* Memory leak(s): -2 pts
